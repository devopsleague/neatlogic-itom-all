## About
NeatLogic is a progressive ITOM platform dedicated to providing ITOM solutions for users of different types and sizes. In addition to the open source version, we also provide secondary development, consulting and other services for enterprise customers. For inquiries, please contact <a href="mailto:zhangzm@neatlogic.com">zhangzm@neatlogic.com</a>,or contact us from <a target="_blank" href="https://join.slack.com/t/neatlogichome/shared_invite/zt-1w037axf8-r_i2y4pPQ1Z8FxOkAbb64w">Slack</a>.
![index](README_IMAGES/index.png)

NeatLogic natively supports multi-tenancy (middleware sharing, database sub-tenant mode), modular expansion, already includes key core functions such as process engine, form engine, report engine, large screen, dashboard, etc., functions sensitive to data scale, such as CMDB Fully considered in the design, taking into account the performance requirements of reports and daily use. When only basic functions are used, only Tomcat, Nginx, and Mysql8+ are required, and some advanced functions, such as automatic collection, require MongoDb. \
NeatLogic provides docker image deployment mode and installation package deployment mode. It comes with all databases and middleware. All key services are encapsulated with start and stop commands. Middleware, software packages and configuration files are separated to facilitate users' daily maintenance.

## Runtime
Operating system: Linux, java version: 8+, process memory: 4G or more, 8G is recommended.

## Project Structure
NeatLogic adopts a modular approach to code management.

- üåé neatlogic-itom-all allows users to obtain all the code at once.
- neatlogic-parent is used to manage the global pom file and all common third-party package references.
- neatlogic-webroot is used to generate war packages and manage submodule references. The pom file can be modified as needed to load different submodules to generate the final war package.
- neatlogic-framework is the base module. All submodules need to reference neatlogic-framework, and the beans of neatlogic-framework can be woven into all submodules.
- neatlogic-tenant is the API part of the basic functionality beans, and is not visible to other submodules.
- neatlogic-web is the front-end code.
- ‚ùå„ÄêTemporarily Not Open Source„Äëneatlogic-master is the backend code of the tenant management module, used to manage the tenant information of neatlogic.
- ‚ùå„ÄêTemporarily Not Open Source„Äëneatlogic-master-web is the front-end code of the tenant management module, and needs to be deployed separately from neatlogic-web during deployment.
- Each other functional module needs to be split into two code modules, namely neatlogic-xxx and neatlogic-xxx-base. Due to the cross-reference limitation of maven, neatlogic-xxx-base is mainly used to be referenced by other modules, mainly containing pojo and some underlying interfaces. neatlogic-xxx needs to reference neatlogic-xxx-base, mainly containing its own exclusive business beans.

## Service Architecture
![Êû∂ÊûÑÂõæ](README_IMAGES/inf.jpeg)
## Internal Plugins
To enhance the efficiency of research and development, we have developed the following IDE plugins to assist in development.
- üöÄ [i18nhelper-idea](../../../i18nhelper-idea/blob/main/README.en.md) is used for automatic replacement of i18n key-value pairs and text translation, exclusively for IntelliJ IDEA. The internationalization of neatlogic's backend did not adopt the official properties format solution of spring 5, but switched to the json format solution consistent with the frontend.
- üöÄ [i18nhelper-vscode](../../../i18nhelper-vscode/blob/main/README.en.md) is used for automatic replacement of i18n key-value pairs and text translation, exclusively for vscode.

## About Branch
- üìå develop x.x.x: Development branch, has not been deployed and finalized in key customers yet. The main features are basically stable, and new features are continuously being added. Some features may be adjusted but will not affect usage.
- üìå release x.x.x: Release branch, has been deployed and finalized in key customers. Core features will not be largely adjusted, only functional adjustments and defect fixes will be made.
- üèÅ (tag) x.x.x: Each version adjustment of release will be tagged correspondingly, usually after feature adjustments or major defect fixes.

## About Version

Neatlogic has divided the version numbers into two ranges for the development and release branches. The development branch uses the interval [0, 1), while the release branch uses the interval [1, ‚àû). This is done to ensure that using version ranges to associate modules does not result in version conflicts.

- üî¢ Develop branch version numbers start with 0, such as 0.3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.
- üî¢ After the release branch is frozen, the release branch version number removes the leading 0. and the trailing -SNAPSHOT, resulting in a version number like 3.1.0. For defect fixes, the third digit is incremented, for example, 3.1.1. For feature improvements, the second digit is incremented, such as 3.2.0.

## About Maven Profile

Neatlogic manages different branch version numbers and module dependencies for the community edition and commercial edition using Maven profiles.

- üìá `develop` is the profile for the development branch. If you are currently on the development branch, select this profile. All dependency package versions end with `-SNAPSHOT`.
- üìá `release` is the profile for the release branch. If you are currently on the release branch, select this profile. All dependency packages have official version numbers.
- üìá `commercial` is the profile specifically for the commercial edition. If you are using the community edition for further development, do not select this profile to avoid depending on any commercial edition modules.

    __‚ùó Note:__ You can choose either `develop` or `release`, but you can select `commercial` along with `develop` or `release`.
